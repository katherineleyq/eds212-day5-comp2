## Some logical operators

-    == (does this match?)

-   != (does these NOT match?)

-   \>, \<, \>=, \<=

-   & (and), \| (or)

```{r}
4 == 5
```

```{r}
4 == 4
```

```{r}
4 != 5
```

```{r}
# Does 4 match "4"?
4 == "4"
```

```{r}
# With assigned variables:
cat <- 10
dog <- 7

cat > dog
```

```{r}
# Is dog greater than cat, OR is cat less than 20?

dog > cat | cat < 20

# Is dog less than cat AND cat == 10?

dog < cat & cat == 10
```

```{r}
View(mtcars)

ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = wt)) +
  geom_point(aes(size = mpg, color = wt)) +
  labs(x = "Car weight (1000 points)", y = "Gas mileage (mpg)", title = "Car weight efficiency relationship" )
```
